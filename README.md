This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Static Product List Component

## Design Decisions

- Used React functional component with no state management, fulfilling the assignment requirement.
- Used `.map()` to iterate over the `products` array and render each item.
- Added simple inline styles for a clean card-like layout.
- Ensured the component is reusable and easy to maintain.

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` or `npm start` depending on your setup.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port) to view the product list.

## Challenges

- Keeping styling minimal and clean.
- Deciding on which product properties to display.
